# POWERGRID App

## Introduction
**POWERGRID** is a mobile application designed to address the challenges of unreliable power supply in Nigeria. By providing real-time information on power availability, consumption monitoring, and management tips, POWERGRID aims to empower users to better navigate and optimize their electricity usage in areas with inconsistent power grids.

## Features

### Core Features
These features are simpler to implement and form the foundation of the app:
- **Real-Time Power Status Map**: A live map showing areas with electricity (green) and outages (red), based on crowdsourced user reports.
- **Power Management Tips**: Static content offering practical advice on energy conservation and strategies for coping with outages.
- **Band Information**: Users can input their electricity tariff band (e.g., Band A, B, C) to view details about costs and service expectations.
- **Power Consumption Monitoring**: Users manually enter meter readings to track and visualize their electricity usage over time.

### Advanced Features
These features are more complex and can be added as the app grows:
- **Power ON Time Statistics**: Crowdsourced data on power uptime for individual households, with area-wide aggregates and trend visualizations.
- **Power Fault Updates**: Real-time notifications and a map of reported power outages and faults.
- **Weather Impact Alerts**: Integration with local weather data to predict potential power disruptions due to storms or other weather events.
- **Alternative Power Source Finder**: A searchable database of nearby locations to buy or rent backup power solutions (e.g., generators, solar panels).
- **Community Features**: Chat or comment sections where users can share updates, tips, or coping strategies during outages.
