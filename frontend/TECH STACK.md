# Tech Stack for POWERGRID App

## Introduction
Hey! Here’s the tech stack I’ve put together for us to build POWERGRID, the app to help people in Nigeria track power availability. I’ve picked tools that should keep things simple for us, especially since I’m new to coding but comfy with design tools like Figma. I also want us to avoid AI-heavy stuff and stick to traditional dev tools we can control ourselves. Let me know what you think!

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend: Vue.js with Vuetify
- **Vue.js**: A JavaScript framework that’s easy to pick up and great for building interactive interfaces.
  - Uses HTML-like templates, which I can handle from my web design background.
  - Perfect for making the app look dynamic and user-friendly.
- **Vuetify**: A library of pre-built components for Vue.js, styled with Material Design.
  - Gives us buttons, forms, and layouts without needing tons of CSS.
  - Should make designing the UI quick and polished.
- **Bonus**: Vue.js can turn the app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it works offline and feels mobile-friendly.

### Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **ASP.NET Core**: A solid framework for the backend to handle data and logic.
  - Lots of docs and tutorials out there to guide us.
  - Great for building APIs the frontend can connect to (like fetching power status or saving reports).
- **Web API**: Keeps it focused on serving data, which should keep things straightforward.

### Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for Development)
- **PostgreSQL**: A free, reliable database for storing all our app data.
  - Not too tricky to use but strong enough for the real thing.
- **SQLite (for Development)**: A super simple database to start with—just a file on the computer.
  - We can switch to PostgreSQL later when we’re ready to go live.

### Hosting: Heroku or Azure
- **Heroku**: Super easy hosting—deploy with a few clicks and no server headaches.
- **Azure**: Another option with free tiers that could save us cash early on.
  - Both let us focus on building instead of managing servers.

### Version Control: Git with GitHub
- **Git**: So we can track changes and work together smoothly.
- **GitHub**: A place to store our code and collaborate.
  - Also a backup and spot to get help if we need it.

### Map Library: Leaflet
- **Leaflet**: A free, lightweight library for interactive maps.
  - Easy to add to Vue.js and perfect for showing power outages or status.
  - No big costs like with Google Maps API.

## Getting Started

### Tools
- **For Frontend (Me)**: I’ll use **Visual Studio Code** (free) with Vue.js extensions.
- **For Backend (You)**: Maybe try **Visual Studio** since it’s good for this kind of work?

### Learning Resources
- **Vue.js**: I’ll check out the [official Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/) or some YouTube tutorials.
- **ASP.NET Core**: [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) looks like it has solid guides.
- **General**: We can find tutorials combining Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to tie it all together.

### Initial Steps
1. **Prototype**: Start small—a page with a map (Leaflet) and one feature (like showing power status).
2. **Core Features**: I’ll work on the UI with Vue.js and Vuetify while you set up the backend with ASP.NET Core.
3. **Collaboration**: We’ll use Git and GitHub to share code and stay in sync.
4. **Expand**: Add more features (like logins or data storage) as we get the hang of it.

## Why I Picked This
- **Easy for Me**: Vue.js and Vuetify seem doable with my design skills and don’t need crazy coding know-how.
- **Fits Us**: We can split the work—me on the frontend, you on the backend—and still make progress.
- **No AI Stuff**: These are regular dev tools, so we’re in charge, not some AI platform.
- **Teamwork**: Separate frontend and backend means we can tackle our parts without stepping on each other’s toes.

## Wrap-Up
So, the plan is **Vue.js with Vuetify (frontend)**, **ASP.NET Core Web API (backend)**, **PostgreSQL/SQLite (database)**, **Heroku/Azure (hosting)**, **Git/GitHub (version control)**, and **Leaflet (maps)**. I think this sets us up to build POWERGRID without too much stress. What do you think—any tweaks or ideas to add?
